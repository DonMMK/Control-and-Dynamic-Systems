### Learning outcomes
-   Develop mathematical models of mechanical, electrical and electromechanical systems.
-   Calculate and estimate the stability measures, error measures and time response measures from the analysis of mathematical models of some simple engineering systems.
-   Design and report on the development of practical controllers and compensators in feedback control systems to achieve the desired behaviour.
